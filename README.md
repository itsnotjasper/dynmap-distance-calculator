# dynmap-distance-calculator

## How to use
Requirements:
- Python 3
- windows-curses (if on windows)

Run `python3 junction_distance.py [road name]`. I am too lazy to clean this up, so no proper file tree for you.\
Arguments:\
`-f, --force, --fetch`: Force-fetches new JSON data. The data will auto-update regardless if the marker file is a day old or more.\
`--verbose`: Verbose script. If you want to look into the nitty gritty, this will be the way. More detail on verbose to be added soon(hopefully).\
`-y, --vertical`: Calculates y-axis alongside x- and z- axes. \
